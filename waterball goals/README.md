The water ball code was not created by me, you can get the original code here: https://www.jqueryscript.net/loading/Liquid-Loading-Indicator-Plugin-jQuery-createWaterBall.html

I have addapted the code to be used in Streamlabs obs to display sub, donations, etc goals.

The original code works with a range of values to select the color of the ball. I have create a small code to have a smoother transition between colors using hsl.
